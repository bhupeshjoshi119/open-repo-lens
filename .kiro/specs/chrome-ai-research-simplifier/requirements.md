# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Enhanced TechHub Research Platform is a comprehensive web application that combines existing GitHub repository analysis capabilities with new Chrome AI-powered research simplification features. The system preserves all current functionality for discovering, analyzing, and managing GitHub repositories while adding intelligent text processing capabilities using Chrome's built-in AI APIs (powered by Gemini Nano) to make research papers, news articles, and policy documents more accessible and understandable.
