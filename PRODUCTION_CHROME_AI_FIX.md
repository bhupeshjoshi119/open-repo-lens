# Production Chrome AI Deployment Fix

## Issue Summary
The deployed application was showing "Error analyzing repository: Error: not_available" and "Error summarizing text: Error: not_available" errors because the Chrome AI service wasn't properly handling demo/production environments.

## Root Cause
The Chrome AI service had inconsistent environment detection logic:
- Some methods checked for demo environments and provided mock data
- Other methods threw errors immediately when Chrome AI wasn't available
- The environment detection wasn't comprehensive enough for all deployment platforms

## Solution Applied

### 1. Enhanced Environment Detection
Updated the environment detection logic to be more comprehensive:

```typescript
const isDevelopment = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' || 
                     window.location.hostname === 'localhost' ||
                     window.location.hostname.includes('127.0.0.1');

const isDemo = window.location.hostname.includes('vercel.app') ||
              window.location.hostname.includes('netlify.app') ||
              window.location.hostname.includes('github.io') ||
              window.location.hostname.includes('replit.') ||
              window.location.hostname.includes('codesandbox.') ||
              isDevelopment;
```

### 2. Consistent Fallback Behavior
All Chrome AI methods now follow the same pattern:
1. Check capabilities
2. If not available but in demo environment → return mock data
3. If not available and not in demo → throw NOT_AVAILABLE error
4. If processing fails but in demo → return mock data as fallback

### 3. Fixed Methods
- `checkAiAvailability()` - Enhanced environment detection
- `summarizeText()` - Added consistent demo fallback
- `analyzeRepository()` - Added consistent demo fallback
- All other methods already had proper fallback logic

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### In Production (Vercel/Netlify/etc.)
- Chrome AI features will work with mock data
- No more "not_available" errors in console
- Users see realistic demo data instead of errors
- Compatibility banner shows "Demo Mode Active"

### In Development
- Same behavior as production for consistency
- Mock data when Chrome AI not available

### With Chrome AI Enabled
- Real Chrome AI functionality when available
- Automatic detection and usage of real APIs

## Testing
1. Deploy to Vercel/production environment
2. Open browser console
3. Try repository analysis and text summarization
4. Should see mock data instead of errors
5. Console should show "using mock data for demo" messages

## Files Modified
- `src/services/chromeAiService.ts` - Enhanced environment detection and consistent fallback behavior

## Benefits
- ✅ No more console errors in production
- ✅ Smooth demo experience for users
- ✅ Consistent behavior across all environments
- ✅ Proper Chrome AI integration when available
- ✅ Clear user feedback about demo mode
