# Select Component Fix Summary

## Issue Fixed
The error "A <Select.Item /> must have a value prop that is not an empty string" was occurring because the MyRepositories component had a SelectItem with `value=""` (empty string).

## Root Cause
Radix UI Select components don't allow empty strings as values because they use empty strings internally to represent cleared selections.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed SelectItem Value
**Before:**
```jsx
<SelectItem value="">
  <div className="flex items-center gap-2">
    <User className="h-4 w-4" />
    Personal
  </div>
</SelectItem>
```

**After:**
```jsx
<SelectItem value="personal">
  <div className="flex items-center gap-2">
    <User className="h-4 w-4" />
    Personal
  </div>
</SelectItem>
```

### 2. Updated State Management
- Changed initial state from `''` to `'personal'`
- Updated logic to check for `selectedOrg !== 'personal'` instead of `selectedOrg`

### 3. Added Safety Checks
- Added optional chaining for `organizations?.map()`
- Added optional chaining for `repositories?.map()`
- Added fallback for repository names
- Improved key generation for topic badges

## Result
- No more Select component errors
- Repository loading should work properly after OAuth is configured
- More robust error handling and data safety

## Next Steps
1. Update GitHub OAuth app settings with correct redirect URIs
2. Test the My Repositories functionality
3. Verify no console errors when clicking on repositories
