# üö® IMMEDIATE PRODUCTION FIX

## üîç Root Cause

The error shows it's still making direct requests to `https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token` instead of using our API route. This is due to:

1. **Browser/CDN Cache** - Old JavaScript is cached
2. **Build Cache** - Vercel serving old build
3. **Deployment Issue** - New code not properly deployed

## ‚ö° IMMEDIATE ACTIONS

### 1. Force Cache Bust (Do This First)

```bash
# Clear all caches and redeploy
git add .
git commit -m "fix: force production OAuth API route deployment"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Verify API Route is Live

Test your API route directly:

```
https://reposcan-one.vercel.app/api/github/oauth/token
```

Should return: `{"error":"Method not allowed"}` (this is correct for GET request)

### 3. Check Vercel Environment Variables

Ensure these are set in Vercel Dashboard:

- `VITE_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`
- `VITE_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `VITE_GITHUB_REDIRECT_URI`

### 4. Force Browser Cache Clear

- Hard refresh: `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
- Or open in incognito/private mode

## üîß If Still Failing

The error suggests old code is running. This means either:

1. Vercel didn't deploy the new code
2. Browser is serving cached JavaScript
3. CDN cache needs clearing

### Emergency Fix - Add Cache Busting

If the above doesn't work, we can force a cache bust by updating the build.
